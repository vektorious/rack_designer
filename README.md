To use this script you need the open source software OpenSCAD (http://www.openscad.org). Just load the script into the software, set the parameters:
1. bottom thickness
2. diameter of vials
3. minimum distance between holes
4. wanted rack dimensions

Press on "render", check the model in the 3D preview screen and export it to .stl!

That's it...
